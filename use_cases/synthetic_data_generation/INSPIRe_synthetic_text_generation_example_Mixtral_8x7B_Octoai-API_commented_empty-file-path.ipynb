    "## The INSPIRe Framework: A Reminder\n",
    "\n",
    "**INSPIRe** is a framework designed to help you outsource code-generation to move faster, learn more, and tackle more projects.<br><BR>It ensures that your model generates functional, optimized, and robust code snippets. Derived from pure trial and error, INSPIRe is not merely a theoretical concept forced into action. Instead, it emerges from real-life tricks, embedding reliability and efficiency at its core.\n",
    "\n",
    "I introduced the framework in the first article, but here's a concise reminder. INSPIRe is an iterative process comprising six steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify (I)**: Determine what you want to do and what you need to do it. Begin with a clear first prompt.\n",
    "- **Narrate (N)**: Convert your instructions into code through detailed prompts.\n",
    "- **Screen (S)**: Review each code snippet and correct the errors. Test and adjust.\n",
    "- **Polish (P)**: Refine your code to improve it. Iterate as much as you need.\n",
    "- **Integrate (I)**: Assemble your code snippets into a cohesive and elegant program.\n",
    "- **Restart (Re)**: Start a new loop when you're done or when you hit a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to break down your coding task into manageable snippets, generating and refining one at a time. Through the INSPIRe framework, you may find yourself iterating multiple times within a single step to achieve the desired quality and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Generation and Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the code snippets below, I went through over 15 INSPIRe iterations. We won't detail each one of them. Instead, we'll focus on the key steps, showing where we made major improvements. The goal is to understand the logic of INSPIRe in the context of real-life situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing packages\n",
    "For simplicity, we'll import all the relevant packages we'll use in the different snippets. The idea is to keep the import as a reference you can come back to whenever you have questions about what each package does.\n"

    "- Make sure the code you write and/or edit is clear and well-commented.\n",

    "- When you first respond, acknowledge the instructions you've been given then ask the user to describe the intentions they want to turn into code.\n",

    "   - A list of `messages`, each with a `role` and `content`, representing the conversation context sent to the model.\n",
    "   - The `model` parameter specifies the model identifier to be used for the completion.\n",
    "   - `max_tokens`, `presence_penalty`, `temperature`, and `top_p` are parameters controlling the completion's length and creativity.\n",
    "4. The response from the API is then converted to a JSON string using `json.dumps`, with formatting for readability.\n",

    "### Generate System Prompt for Sentiment Analysis - Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous function, `generate_system_prompt_sentiment`, dynamically creates system prompts for generating synthetic product reviews with a specified sentiment. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Product Data**: It starts by reading product data from a JSON file, specified by `json_file_path`.\n",
    "2. **Random Product Selection**: A subset of products is randomly selected based on `batch_size`, ensuring varied data for the reviews.\n",
    "3. **Sentiment Handling**: Depending on the `sentiment` argument, it prepares instructions to generate reviews with positive, negative, or a balanced mix of sentiments.\n",
    "4. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**: A detailed system prompt is constructed, outlining the task of creating synthetic reviews, including instructions for the review's tone and content.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Parameters:\n",
    "- `json_file_path` (str): Path to the JSON file with product data.\n",
    "- `batch_size` (int): Number of products to process.\n",
    "- `sentiment` (str): Target sentiment for the reviews ('positive', 'negative', or other for a mix).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Returns:\n",
    "- A string that contains the system prompt with detailed instructions for generating synthetic reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt instructs the generation of a table listing fictional audience members. For each audience member, there's information about the selected products, their brand, product name, rating, and comment.
